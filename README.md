### Problem statement

The purpose of the project was to create a Shop Program in both C programming language and Python. For the shop in Python, we have to create the shop in the Procedural programming methoolgy and in Object Orientated programming based on the functionality requirements set by the lecturer.

#### Contents of the folder:
* C - Contains the c program with a.exe, which is 
the compiled version to run.
* python_oop - Object Orientated Programming version of the shop.
* python_proc - The Procedural Python version of the shop.
* customer1.csv - The file to read in customer name, budget, and shopping list.
* customer2.csv - The file to read in customer name, budget, and shopping list.
* customer3.csv - The file to read in customer name, budget, and shopping list.
* read.txt
* report.pdf - Comparing the programs and reporting on findings. 
* stock.csv - The file to read in the shop float with the products and product prices. 

#### Programs Used
- VS code 
- Python 3
- pdf

#### How to run the programs

Please compile the c program before running and ensure that your terminal or command line program you are using has UTF-8 encoding enabled. To complie enter:

gcc -g shop.c 

To run the program we can then use the following:

./a.exe

For Python please use a Python environment.

The programs can then be run from Terminal by typing `python` followed by the filename as follows:

python shop_oop.py
python shop.py
